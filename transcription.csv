" Hello, I am not feeling well. I have had a fever for the past 2 days and my body feels very weak. I also have stomach pain that started yesterday and I feel nauseous. I don't have much appetite and I feel tired most of the time. I am not sure if I ate something bad or it is an infection. I have taken some rest but the symptoms are still there. Can you please tell me what might be the problem and what I should do next?"
